## Project Description

Our project addresses the difficulties of Bryn Mawr Students in navigating the college website and finding the information they need quickly. College websites are notorious for being hard to navigate and when a student is in a pinch, do they have time to go through 100+ drop-down menus? Our Athena Bot recognizes user commands and provides them with the correct information on demand without the need to go through the college website. Our project simplifies student life and helps Bryn Mawr students 24/7 through Discord. 

## Protoype Summary

Our Athena Bot is a Discord bot, meaning that users of Bryn Mawr will be able to add the bot to their channel and input commands like /menu and /bus saturday to get the information they desire. The user can ask a series of commands and get the information instantly. We would like to implement more commands and integrate the bot with more campus services, which means more usability and more information available to the user.

## Next Steps

- Allowing the user to input feedback on the bot functionality
- Integrate the bot with the campus website so that the bot can update new and time-sensitive information
- Developing an event database, showing on-campus events to the students if commanded
